# Homework 3

## Task 1: Implementation of Ivy Architecture
Refer to [IvyBasic](./IvyBasic)

## Task 2: Implementation of Fault-Tolerant Ivy
Refer to [IvyFaultTolerant](./IvyFaultTolerant) for the implementation.

Refer to [Ivy Fault Tolerant Design](./IvyFaultTolerant/Design.md) for the design. This includes a series of sequence diagrams that explore potential issues in the design, and how the design solves them.

## Task 3: Sequential Consistency of Fault-Tolerant Ivy
Refer to [Ivy Fault Tolerant Design](./IvyFaultTolerant/Design.md) (all the way at the bottom).

## Task 4: Experiments
Refer to [Experiments](./Experiments.md)
